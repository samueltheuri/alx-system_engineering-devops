## 0x09. Web infrastructure design
> Web Infrastructure is the physical hardwarem transmission media, and software used to interconnect computers and users on the internet.
> It includes internet servers, web servers, internet storage, network equipment and infructructure software.
> The design is the architecture on the environment to ensure faster response time to users or clients and also allow for further scale in future.

### Horizontal and vertical scaling.
* Horizontal scaling or scaling out involves adding additional servers.
* Vertical scaling or scaling up involves adding more resources to the existing servers.

### Files Descriptions
0. `0-simple_web_stack` - a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com.
1. `1-distributed_web_infrastructure` - a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.
2. `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure` - a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.
3. `3-scale_up` - Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server
